###Odin project EtchASketch

I had a lot of fun with this project. Started off watching a youtube tutorial. That dev used all DOM manipulation. I recreated his working code but I realized I really wanted to style this up and I decided pure DOM manipulation would have been a bit more difficult to do. 

I then looked at a few solutions posted on the Odin project page and found one I understood most of the code and it had components I also liked. I used that code along with bits of the youtube video to build out the working Javascript. 

Styled and scaffolded to my specifications. 

Used HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla Javascript (DOM, EventListners, If Else, Functions)
